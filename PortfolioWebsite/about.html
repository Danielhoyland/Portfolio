                Hi! My name is Daniel Høyland. I'm from Sandnes, a city near Stavanger in Norway, and I currently live
                in
                Trondheim as a student. I have completed my bachelor's degree in Programming at NTNU in Gjøvik and have
                experience with a variety of programming languages, libraries, and frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about continuous learning and believe that you can never truly stop growing. I enjoy
                exploring new technologies, understanding how they work, and learning how to use them effectively. I am
                always eager to enhance my skills in programming techniques, code structuring, and emerging technologies
                to
                become an even better programmer.
            </p>

                I completed a Bachelor's degree in Programming at NTNU Gjøvik. Currently, during 2024-2025, I am taking
                additional courses in preparation for applying to a Master's program in Informatics.

            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy playing games and creating programs for myself or my friends, whether to
                support other hobbies or just for fun. I also like to play chess, engage in tabletop games with friends,
                and stay active through training.
