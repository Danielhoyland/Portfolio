                My name is Daniel Høyland, i have finished my bachelor in Programming at NTNU in Gjøvik. I have experience with many different languages, libraries and frameworks.
                I am an avid learner, i belive that you are never truly finished learning. I love exploring new technologies, figuring out how they work, and how to use them effectivley.
