          <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>
          <p>
            I learned a lot about animation, event-driven function handling,
            control mechanisms, and UI design to enhance the user experience in
            video games. Most of what I learned is highly specific to game
            programming, and even more narrowly focused on using Unity. As a
            result, transitioning to another game engine would likely be
            challenging

            <h3>The game Idea</h3>
            <p>
              Our idea was to create a running game where the player spawns and
              tries to reach the finish line in various levels. The unique twist
              is that the player can throw a ball to teleport to its location.
              Beyond that, we experimented with different ideas, controls, and
              overall game feel during development, adding features like camera
              movements, camera shake, sound effects, and particle effects.
