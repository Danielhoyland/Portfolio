        <p>
          The field of cloud computing and cloud technologies is dynamic. It
          changes rapidly. There are some fundamental concepts that stay
          relatively unchanged, and there is an innovation in tools and
          technologies that often change. Due to those characteristics, the
          course lectures are subject to change, based on contemporary market
          adjustments. The typical coverage includes, but is not limited to:<br />

          - Architectural Types and Principles (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)<br />

          - Cloud Technologies (Processing, Storage, Network, Virtualisation)<br />

          - API Standards (e.g., REST) and Standardisation Bodies (i.e.,
          IETF)<br />

          - Cloud Vendors and Economics of Cloud Services (Business models,
          Pricing models, Service-level agreements)<br />

          - Cloud Operations Basics<br />

          - Development and Deployment of Cloud Applications

          <p>
            In this subject, I gained a deeper understanding of APIs and learned
            how to program in Golang to create and utilize APIs for sending and
            receiving data.

              The first assignment was alone and here we used two APIs about
              countries and universities to be able to use like "NOR" to find
              all universities in Norway or find all neighboring countries of
              Norway.

            <p>
              The second assignment involved creating an API for a large CSV
              file containing climate data for most countries. The API allowed
              filtering the data based on parameters such as country, date, CO2
              emissions, and more.
