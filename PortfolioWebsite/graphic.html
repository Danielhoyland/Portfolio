          <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>
          <p>
            This subject focused heavily on low-level programming, which was a
            significant shift from my other courses. Initially, it was
            challenging, but as time went on, it became much more enjoyable and
            manageable. I gained extensive knowledge in object creation through
            programming, camera movements, rendering, shading, texturing, and
            applying lighting effects in graphical programming. Additionally, I
            became more conscious and aware of memory management and how to
            prevent memory leaks throughout this course.
