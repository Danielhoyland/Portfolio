            <h2>Subject Description</h2>
            <p>The bachelor thesis is based on either a problem/thesis proposal obtained from business, public sector or
                the academic community. The proposals must be pre-approved by the course coordinator. Through the
                assignment, students will identify, formulate and solve relevant problems within programmers' field of
                work. The candidate must use knowledge and skills from several subject areas in the study, as well as
                independent specialization where necessary. Through the bachelor thesis, the candidate must contribute
                to either research or development. The candidate must also acquire skills in project management,
                planning, implementation and documentation of a project work.

                The bachelor thesis must include software development, and may also have elements of research,
                innovation or entrepreneurship.</p>

                <h2>What the Bachelor for was about </h2>
                <p>Me and my group got a task from Innoveria with the the following task from them</p>
                <p>
                    Our task is to create a web application that collects, stores, and displays electrical usages from
                    sensors placed on machines within a factory setting. The application should be available on PC and
                    tablet and deliver an intuitive user experience. It should also be scalable and expandable, allowing
                    new features to be added with relative ease by a new developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the application should contain the following functionality:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overview page that displays collected data:

                    <h3>The Project</h3>
                    <p>The project was divided into three main components: Frontend (design), Backend (APIs and
                        Database), and the LoRaWAN server (connection and data collection).</p>
                    <p>Throughout the project, the team utilized Scrum as an agile framework.</p>
                    <p>The project was successful, and you can view the final product on the right. It was built using
                        the technologies and programming languages mentioned above. This system integrates the database,
                        the website, and Rak gateways through APIs, automatically collecting, processing, and storing
                        data from sensors monitoring the power usage of manufacturing machines. Users can view this data
                        in near real-time.</p>
                    <p>If you are interested in a more detailed overview of the project, you can read the full report <a

                    <h3>What I learned from the project</h3>
                    <p>I gained significant experience from this project, including improving database structuring,
                        automating data processing and storage, and developing with React.js. I also applied Scrum
                        methodology in a real-world setting, working on a practical task. Additionally, I enhanced my
                        skills in client interaction by participating in meetings to refine the project based on
                        feedback..</p>
