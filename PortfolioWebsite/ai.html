            <p>The course focus on data-driven AI topics including machine learning, Bayesian networks, deep learning
                and we will look at popular and successful applications of these techniques in image processing and
                natural language processing. Practical applications and real world examples will be carefully walked
                through so that the students can follow and understand a complete AI project. Lab exercises, and
                obligatory assignments are important instruments to ensure learning progress with well-defined
                milestones.</p>

                <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>
                <p>In this subject, I gained a fundemental understanding of the mathematical foundations behind AI and
                    how it
                    creates connections. Additionally, I learned how to develop simple AI models capable of detecting
                    language and categorizing text, images, videos, and performing more detailed detection tasks.</p>

                    <p>As shown in the image to the right, we applied image detection AI during the course. For
                        instance, we used it to differentiate between cats and dogs, and to detect cars in images, as
                        demonstrated by the mask on the right. In this task, we trained an AI model on car images,
                        enabling it to generate a mask that highlights all objects identified as cars.</p>

                    <h3>Example of more complex AI detection</h3>
                    <p>In a similar manner to the previous example, I developed an emotion detection AI. It was trained
                        using facial images displaying various emotions, allowing the model to learn how to identify
                        emotions in human faces. However, this task required significantly more RAM than earlier
                        projects, as each emotion needed a large set of images for the AI to learn effectively.
                        Unfortunately, due to insufficient RAM, I had to reduce the number of training images and limit
                        the number of epochs. As a result, the AI achieved only 53% accuracy.</p>
