                    <h3>Project in mobile porgramming</h3>
                    <p>In this course, we worked on a project where we had to develop a mobile application with
                        functionality. My group and I created InkReader, which is a mobile application similar to
                        Duolingo to make it easy track their book reading and encurage them to read more. We added
                        calendar view to
                        see how many pages a person have read each date, let the user adjust their page reading goal
                        and a aquarium that becomes more and more populated with fish based by the users reading s
                        streak.</p>

                    <h3>Personal Projects, and Post-Course Learning</h3>
                    <p>In my free time after the course, I worked on several personal projects. One of these was a quote
                        app for my friends, where we could save quotes, filter them by person, and get a random quote. I
                        also added a drinking game feature where users guess who said the quote. Through this project, I
                        gained a deeper understanding of combining and storing data to enhance functionality. I also
                        learned how to implement gestures, such as swiping left to trigger certain actions.</p>

                    <p>Another app I developed was for a tabletop game, designed to streamline certain tasks that were
                        previously done manually. Creating this app in mobile form not only made the game more efficient
                        but also allowed me to learn more about mobile development in a fun and practical way.</p>

                    <p>After completing the course and these projects, I started researching React Native as an
                        alternative. Since Iâ€™m proficient in React, I found React Native approachable, and it offered a
                        solution to my limitation of developing only for Android. With React Native, I could create apps
                        for both Android and iOS simultaneously.</p>
