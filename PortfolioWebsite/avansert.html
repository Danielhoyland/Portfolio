        <h2>Subject Description</h2>
        <p>
          The course introduces students to a wide spectrum of programming
          languages and programming paradigms, focusing on multi-paradigm
          aspects and modern features of programming languages. The course
          covers the fundamentals of lambda calculus and functional programming
          style, lazy computations, memory management, event-driven and reactive
          programming, as well as multi-threaded and concurrent programming
          patterns. The course also uses novel programming techniques such as
          Smart Contracts. Languages used might cover, but not be limited to,
          Rust, Haskell, Golang, Java/Kotlin and Dart, Solidity. References to
          modern C++ and other languages are made.

          <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>
          <p>
            In this course, I learned both Haskell and Rust, along with improved
            programming practices, deeper programming understanding, and best
            practices. The course was quite challenging, and Haskell was
            particularly difficult to grasp at first, but I was able to learn
            and apply it successfully.

            <h3>Haskell Project</h3>
            <p>
              In this project, we had to recreate the game GO. You can see and
              test the game for yourself on this
              <a href="https://online-go.com/">site</a>. The challenging aspect
              of developing a game in Haskell is that it doesn't support
              traditional for or while loops, so I had to rely on recursive
              functions. Wrapping my head around that was difficult at first.
              Because of this, and my inexperience at the time, I ended up
              creating one of the most compact functions imaginable, which is
              something I now try to avoid at all costs, haha. You can see it on

            <h3>Rust Project</h3>
            <p>
              In this project, we were tasked with creating an interpreter. The
              task description included a list of required functions it needed
              to handle, such as basic mathematical operations between two
              numbers and various other functions like `dup`, which duplicates
              the input variable. This project was really enjoyable, but due to
              the large size of the first project and other assignments from
              different subjects, time constraints became an issue. I managed to
              complete about 50% of the assignment before the deadline, which
              was a bit disappointing since I found programming in Rust quite
              fun.
