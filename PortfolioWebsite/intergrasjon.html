        <p>
          In this course, students work on a group project where they combine
          and expand upon themes from various individual topics in their study
          program. Because of this, the course is often referred to as a
          "mini-bachelor," serving as a prequel to the bachelor's project. In
          their project, the students will integrate and work with themes such
          as mobile/web-applications, distributed/centralized solutions,
          graphics/game-programming, artificial intelligence, database, cloud
          technologies, networking or virtualization.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through the project work, the students will work with agile
          development processes, project planning, requirements specification,
          design, implementation, testing, sustainability, artificial
          intelligence, information security and documentation.

          <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>
          <p>
            This project was the first undertaking of our studies, where we
            integrated different technologies to create a cohesive product.
            Additionally, we collaborated as a team, which provided a more
            authentic experience compared to a traditional classroom setting.
            From this project, I learned about agile development practices,
            specifically Scrum, and gained proficiency in React. I also
            discovered how to connect a website to a database and effectively
            manage data retrieval without pulling too much or too little
            information.

            <h3>Our project</h3>
            <p>
              In this project, we brainstormed several ideas but ultimately
              decided on one called FridgeIO. The concept was a website where
              you, along with your family or roommates, could add ingredients
              stored in the fridge and cabinets, track common items, and log
              expiration dates to reduce food waste. It also allows you to check
              what you already have at home, even while you're in the store.
              This was the foundation of the idea. On the right, you can see a
              screenshot of the application. We placed a strong emphasis on
              mobile users throughout the project, as we anticipated that most
              people would use the app either in the kitchen or while shopping,
              where laptops or desktop computers are less convenient.

            <h3>The process of the project</h3>
            <p>
              In this project, we dedicated a significant amount of time to
              perfecting the database structure, as well as creating a
              user-friendly and functional wireframe. On the left, you can see
              the ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) for the project. Since the
              data and functionality were relatively simple, the ERD turned out
              to be straightforward and easy to work with. The wireframe
              reflected the design we aimed to implement, prioritizing
              usability. However, due to time constraints, limited experience at
              the time, and challenges in integrating some features, we were
              unable to fully achieve our design goals.
