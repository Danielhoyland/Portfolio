        <p>
          In this course the students have a group project where they combine
          and expand themes from a number of individual topics in their study
          program. In their project, the students will integrate and work with
          themes such as mobile/web-applications, distributed/centralized
          solutions, graphics/game-programming, artificial intelligence,
          database, cloud technologies, networking or virtualization.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through the project work, the students will work with agile
          development processes, project planning, requirements specification,
          design, implementation, testing, sustainability, artificial
          intelligence, information security and documentation.

          <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>
          <p>
            This project was the first undertaking of our studies, where we
            integrated different technologies to create a cohesive product.
            Additionally, we collaborated as a team, which provided a more
            authentic experience compared to a traditional classroom setting.
            From this project, I learned about agile development practices,
            specifically Scrum, and gained proficiency in React. I also
            discovered how to connect a website to a database and effectively
            manage data retrieval without pulling too much or too little
            information.
