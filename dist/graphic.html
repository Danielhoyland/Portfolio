          <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>
          <p>
            This subject focused heavily on low-level programming, which was a
            significant shift from my other courses. Initially, it was
            challenging, but as time went on, it became much more enjoyable and
            manageable. I gained extensive knowledge in object creation through
            programming, camera movements, rendering, shading, texturing, and
            applying lighting effects in graphical programming. Additionally, I
            became more conscious and aware of memory management and how to
            prevent memory leaks throughout this course.

            <h3>Project 1 of the Course</h3>
            <p>
              In the first project, we learned how to program using OpenGL and
              CMake to create graphical boxes with textures, colors, and to
              simulate camera movement around the objects. When I mention
              "camera movement," it's actually an illusion; instead of moving
              the camera, we moved the objects themselves. By the end of the
              project, we had a chessboard with "camera" movements, multiple
              textured objects, and the ability to move chess pieces. You can
              see a demo video as a GIF to the right. If you look closely,
              you'll notice the textures look a bit off—and they were! I applied
              the textures incorrectly to both the chess pieces and the board,
              which caused the texture to appear distorted. However, I learned
              from this experience and improved on it significantly in the
              second project.

              which is a limitation of the format. If you'd like to see the
              video with a smoother frame rate, you can find it in the code

              there's a video with better quality.

            <h3>Project 2 of the Course</h3>
            <p>
              This project was a three-day exam where we were tasked with
              creating a Sokoban lookalike just in 3D. Sokoban is a classic puzzle game in which the
              player must push boxes to their correct locations in a warehouse.
              You can play the original 2D version of the game
              <a href="https://www.sokobanonline.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this project, I used the objects and knowledge from Project 1
              and applied them here. It was much easier to start and build the
              program this time. The challenging parts were the lighting and
              texturing. Both issues arose because I had changed how I applied
              textures based on the mistakes from Project 1. In short, I had set
              all the objects as one with texture coordinates at (0.0), instead
              of treating each object separately. Additionally, since I hadn't
              worked with lighting in the previous project, I wasn't sure how it
              should look. Eventually, I managed to resolve the problems with
              texturing and lighting.
