## Contributions
 1. Edited the 01-sdlhello/README.md for how to get the sdl2 dlls to work for it.
 2. Was one of 3 people that tried to get SDL2 to work for windows
## Labs
- Like shown in the Labs.md file i have got a check for 5 out of 7 labs. All files are explained to some degree in the labs under labs dir in this repo. - One lab is not the right file, i has written about it int the md file and put a link for
## Assignments
- I have written some things about each assignment and showed some code for both assignments in the Assignment.md file in the dir for both assignments. - Both assignments was delivered and done to some degree.
First assignment didn't work for both illgal move and captureing, but in this repo it works.
## Obligs

- Here is the link for oblig one sincei have made a gitlab repo for it if you want to look: https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no/course/prog2006/prog2006-2023-workspace/daniehoy/Oblig1 
## Self Reflections
- I think i have done a lot of good in this course this semster. I managed to get whole assignment1 to work and a lot of assignment 2 work. There is of course a lot of things that can be better but based on the little time we had since this semester was VERY packed by all the courses i think i did really good, espacially when i wasted like a month on trying to get SDL2 to work. Many of the mistakes i have done have been repeating but there was little i could do with the time frame to try to fix assignment 1 and 2 on thee aspects. Firstly Assignment 1 had some modularity and clearity issues on especially one function. The function didn't even work fully when i delivered it for the peer review. Ofc the people peer reviewing it couldn't help me with my issues but in the i managed to fix those issues but i didn't want to try to even untagle that function since that would have taken a lot of time to make sure it worked again after untangeling it. For Assignment 2 the modularity issue came from poor planning and very little time. When you review the assignment 2 you can see that it dont have a lot of function and don't even have a repl mode. I really just didn't have time with everyting when i deliverd it and now after it.
- I am really proud of myself of managing to get most of the labs and manageing to have decent functioning assignments. Addionally i did both of the obligs.
If I had to take this course again the only thing i would probably change based on how this semester was, is that I use linux for Assignment 1 with SDL2 since there where bugs and a pain with SDL2 on windows.
