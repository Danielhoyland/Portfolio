# Bprog Interpreter
## Rust-based interpreter for Bprog language

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine in a directory of your choice.
2. Open an IDE, such as Visual Studio Code, and open the project to view the code.
3. To run the interpreter, use the command "cargo run" in the terminal of your IDE, or navigate to the project directory in your command prompt and then execute the interpreter.
4. To test the interpreter, navigate to the project directory in your command prompt and use the command "cargo test".
5. To execute a command in the interpreter, enter it in the command line interface, for example: "1 1 +". 

## Project Specification
### Functional Requirements
- Tokenize inputs
- Use stack operations
- Use bool operations
- Use length
- Use arithmetic operations like +, -, /, *, div, mod, etc.
- Have two modes: one where values are saved to stack, and one where they are not.
- Compare values and strings
- Implement literals correctly
- Implement lists and list logic
- Implement control flow
- Implement symbol variable and dictionary
- Provide error handling for the user

### Non-functional Requirements
- Written in Rust
- Error handling for programmer
- Testing all aspects of functionality
- Code is properly documented with comments
- Modular design
- Easy to understand
- Easy to add more functionality

### Implemented Features
- Tokenization of inputs
- Stack operations
- Boolean operations
- Length
- Arithmetic operations like +, -, /, *, div, mod, etc.
- Comparing values and strings
- Correct implementation of literals

### Not Implemented Features
- List commands
- The second mode of the interpreter
- Control flow
- Symbol variable and dictionary
- Error handling for the user

## Assessment Specification
- All tests must be in place and easy to run to check various aspects of the code
- Issue tracker should be used with meaningful commit messages
- Descriptive documentation should be included, detailing what the program should do and what has been implemented
- A show-and-tell video presentation is required.

## Self-Assessment 
I would say that my implementation was good, it has some of the features it should have as an interpreter. It doesnt have an stack mode. There aren't really any issues and randim sized commits. The program runs very good for what was added and the tests are good. If i would grade my own program and work its probably a 60/100 jsut based of the amount of work it was.
## Show-and-tell Presentation
A video presentation of the program's demo, code, assessment, and reflections should be provided, with the video link added to the Self-Assessment report.
