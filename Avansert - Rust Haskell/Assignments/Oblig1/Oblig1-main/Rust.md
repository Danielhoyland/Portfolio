### Rust book up to chapter 9 inclusive and chapter 13

- Fundamentals (Ch 1 and 2)
    1. I  think i have a good understanding about how to operate and basic stuff.
- Functions, control flow, variables, mutability (Ch 3)
    1. I have a very high understanding about this i think, haven't programmed too much in Rust yet but seems pretty simillar to other languages.
- Ownership, references and borrowing, borrow-checker (Ch 4)
    1. Have like a decent understanding but haven't really programmed in rust so i would not say i am comfortable with it since it was somewhat difficult to understand right away.
- Structs and methods (Ch 5)
    1. I have pretty good understanding 
- Pattern matching, match, if let (Ch 6)
    1. I think i  understand this but would have difficulty implemting it right away but seems pretty usefull, just a lot to take in.
- Packages, crates, modules, visibility, public API (Ch 7) 
    1. I understand the basics and like the path thingy but would need to look up and read again when it comes up for me when i code.
- Collections (Ch 8) 
    1. Pretty sure i understood this but as said i haven't programmed that much in rust so can't say for sure that i really came to understand this or not but seemed usefull and easy to see where to use stuff from this chapter.
- Error handling (Ch 9) 
    1. understand in theory, difficult in practice since it difficult to excaclty know where, when andh ow to excatly do good error handling without using error handling first
- Functional language features, closures and lambdas (Ch 13) 
    1. I understood some of it but the information was very difficult to remember and would be even more difficult to be able to use but i know of the existence of it.
