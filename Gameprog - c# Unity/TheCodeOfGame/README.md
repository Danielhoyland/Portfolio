## Description

Acrobaticball is a 2D platformer style game with a niche, the player can throw a ball, and then teleport to said ball, or they can recall it. The artstyle is varied but mostly pixelated graphics with variations in the design.

The game is completley offline with no multiplayer functionality, to run the game simply run the executable within the build folder.
